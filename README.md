fridge
======

This is a file to teach my son (13 Years) some ruby basics.

I asked him to choose one simple thing with minor mechanics from our household. He chose the fridge, and so we began to analyse the functions of a fridge. Our frige has two parts - a cooler and a freezer. 

Now we re going to implement simple methods. Any help appreciated ;-)

Thx, Peter
